# Setup: CodeSandbox.io version

Use these instructions if you prefer to complete this tutorial _online_ using [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/).

Simply open your browser to [our application template](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/test-er-8-or/tic-tac-toe/tree/00-set-up/), then click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the code. Bookmark that URL. You can come back to it at any time. We've done all the set up for you.

**NOTE: This puts you at the end of the _Setup_ step. With this CodeSandbox instance, you are ready to proceed with [Step 01: Adding the game board](https://github.com/test-er-8-or/tic-tac-toe/tree/01-add-the-game-board).**

This is the fastest way to go, but it does have some drawbacks. For one thing, set up and configuration is, we kid you not, the _hardest_ part of being a programmer. And the most annoying. The sad truth is that programmers (and especially web developers) spend way more time than we should trying to get everything set up and working properly. Efforts at standardisation and virtualization have improved things somewhat, but there is still a long way to go.

So doing the set up the long way might be worth the trouble. You'll have to do it eventually anyway&mdash;you can't build all your apps in CodeSandbox!

The other drawback is that you have to be online to work, and if connectivity is iffy, that could be a problem. If you're in a classroom with many students using the network simultaneously, we can't guarantee a fast or consistent connection. Be warned. But if you're working from home, or have a very fast connection, CodeSandbox might be the way to go, at least for a first run through the material.

If you use the CodeSandbox method, we strongly recommend that you register for a GitHub account (if you don't already have one) and log in to CodeSandbox with GitHub. That will give you extra superpowers that will help you to track your progress and come back to it.

Good luck with the tutorial! Here are all the steps (so far):
